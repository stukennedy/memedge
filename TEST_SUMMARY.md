# Test Summary

## Overview

The Memedge library now has a comprehensive test suite covering all core memory functionality.

## Test Results

**✅ All 37 tests passing!**

## Test Files

### 1. memory-blocks.test.ts (16 tests)

Tests for the Letta-inspired memory block system:

- ✅ Database initialization
- ✅ Block creation (core and archival)
- ✅ Block retrieval (get by ID, return null for non-existent)
- ✅ Block updates (update content, insert at start/end, replace content, rethink)
- ✅ Block deletion
- ✅ Archival memory (insert, search)
- ✅ Context building (with blocks, empty)
- ✅ Error handling (non-existent blocks)

### 2. semantic-search.test.ts (12 tests)

Tests for semantic search with Cloudflare AI:

- ✅ Cosine similarity calculations (identical, orthogonal, opposite, zero vectors)
- ✅ Embedding generation with Cloudflare AI
- ✅ Embedding storage (blocks and archival)
- ✅ Embedding retrieval (get all blocks, get all archival)
- ✅ Database initialization (embeddings tables)

### 3. memory-migration.test.ts (9 tests)

Tests for migration between legacy and block systems:

- ✅ Migration needed detection (needed, not needed, already done)
- ✅ Legacy memory migration (migrate to blocks, skip when no legacy data)
- ✅ Rollback migration (restore from backup, fail when no backup)
- ✅ Export blocks to legacy format (convert labels to purpose keys)

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- **Memory Blocks**: Core CRUD operations, insert/replace/rethink operations
- **Semantic Search**: Embeddings generation, storage, retrieval, and similarity search
- **Migration**: Bidirectional migration between legacy and block systems
- **Error Handling**: Proper error cases for invalid operations
- **Context Building**: Memory context generation for LLMs

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage

# UI mode
npm run test:ui
```

## Test Utilities

- **Vitest**: Fast test runner
- **Effect**: For Effect-based runtime testing
- **Vi**: For mocking SQL storage and AI bindings

## Mock Setup

Tests use comprehensive mocking:

- **SqlStorage**: Mocked Durable Objects SQL
- **Ai binding**: Mocked Cloudflare AI for embeddings
- **Layer system**: Effect layers for dependency injection

## What's Not Tested Yet

The following could be added in future:

- Integration tests with real Durable Objects
- Integration tests with real Cloudflare AI
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory tools execution tests
- Summarization tests (recursive and simple)
- State manager integration tests

## Notes

- All tests pass with 0 linter errors
- Tests are isolated and use proper mocking
- Tests cover both success and failure cases
- Effect runtime is properly setup for each test
